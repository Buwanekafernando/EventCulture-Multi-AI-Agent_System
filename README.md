EventCulture ‚Äì Multi-Agent Event Finder (Sri Lanka)

EventCulture is a smart, AI-powered multi-agent event finder web application designed to help users discover both physical and virtual events happening across Sri Lanka.
The system uses five intelligent agents to collect, analyze, recommend, and guide users toward events that match their preferences.

Overview

EventCulture makes event discovery simple and intelligent.
It offers two types of user versions:

Free Version: Users have limited access to event recommendations and features.

Pro Version: Users enjoy full access with advanced features such as personalized recommendations, unlimited searches, and enhanced navigation.

 Multi-Agent System Architecture

EventCulture is powered by five core agents, each responsible for specific intelligent behaviors.

Stores them in the event database table

Automatically updates the latest events

Removes outdated or cancelled event entries

2) NLP Agent

This agent processes event data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Summarizes event descriptions

Classifies event types (e.g., Music, Tech, Art, Sports, etc.)

Updates the event table with enhanced, meaningful metadata

3) Recommendation Agent

This agent powers the event recommendation system.

Filters events based on user preferences and selected categories

Manages Free vs. Pro user limits (e.g., limited search access for free users)

Continuously improves personalized suggestions

4) Location Agent

This agent assists users in navigating to the event location.
